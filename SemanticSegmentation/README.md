In this folder a NN is used to try to solve a semantic segmenation problem.

The architecure of the NN is <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00561.pdf >Segnet</a>


Usage:

  
config1.yaml -> it contains the main parameters of the CNN.

train.py -> it has implemented the training and it is used a generator provided by Keras.

Segnet -> it has implemented the Segnet architecture.

DataGenerator -> handmade generator.
