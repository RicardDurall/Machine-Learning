In this folder a NN is used to try to solve a semantic segmenation problem.

The architecure of the NN is <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00561.pdf >Segnet</a>

Usage:
 <ul>
  <li>config1.yaml -> it contains the main parameters of the CNN.</li>
  <li>train.py -> it has implemented the training and it is used a generator provided by Keras.</li>
  <li>Segnet -> it has implemented the Segnet architecture.</li>
  <li>DataGenerator -> handmade generator.</li>
</ul>
